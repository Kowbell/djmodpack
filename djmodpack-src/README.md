# INSTRUCTIONS (5 minutes or less, or your money back!)
"Double click a file, tweak one setting in Minecraft, copy two folders, run the game to make sure it works."

Forge AND OptiFine are included in this!

## 1. Install Forge
1. Install the forge .jar file by double clicking it. Install the **client.** If it don't work go to Google.
3. Open your Minecraft Launcher and **DON'T START THE GAME YET!**
4. Go to the Installations tab and edit the forge profile
5. Change the Game directory to the `versions/1.16.3-forge-34.1.42` folder. This way your mods and saves for that folder will be isolated to just that version so you don't fuck your shit up.
6. Run this new version and make a new empty world to ensure everything's working. If things break go to Google. You can delete the world when you're done.

## 2. Install Mods
1. Find the mods folder for your new Minecraft installation. You can copy the path from those Installation settings you opened earlier. 

(Windows: drop `%APPDATA%\.minecraft\versions\1.16.3-forge-34.1.42` in that top bar)

2. Copy everything inside the `mods/` folder in your dj.zip into the `mods/` folder in your version directory.
3. Copy everything inside the `config/` folder in your dj.zip into the `config/` folder in your version directory.
3. Run Minecraft and try to start another new world to make sure things are still working.
