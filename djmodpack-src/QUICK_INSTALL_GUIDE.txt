"Double click a file, tweak one setting in Minecraft, copy two folders, 
        & run the game to make sure it works!"

Forge AND OptiFine are included in this! 
You DON'T need to DOWNLOAD ANYTHING extra unless you really wanna?


## 1. Install Forge (PACKAGED IN THIS ZIP)
1. Install the forge .jar file by double clicking it.
   Install the **FORGE CLIENT**.

   If the forge .jar doesn't open a little blue window doesn't show up
   or Windows asks you how to open it, you need to install Java on your computer.
   Here's links for those:
WINDOWS: https://github.com/Kowbell/djmodpack/releases/download/2.4/jre-8u271-windows-x64.zip
MAC: https://github.com/Kowbell/djmodpack/releases/download/2.4/jre-8u271-macosx-x64.zip

3. Open your Minecraft Launcher and ******DON'T START THE GAME YET!******

4. Go to the Installations tab and edit the forge profile

5. Change the Game directory to the `.minecraft/versions/1.16.3-forge-34.1.42` folder. 
   This way your mods and saves for that folder will be isolated to just that 
   version so you don't fuck your shit up.

6. Run this new version and make a new empty world to ensure everything's working. 
   If things break go to Google. You can delete the world when you're done.



## 2. Install Mods (ALSO PACKAGED IN THIS ZIP)
1. Find the mods folder for your new Minecraft installation. 
   You can copy the path from those Installation settings you opened earlier. 
   (Windows: drop `%APPDATA%\.minecraft\versions\1.16.3-forge-34.1.42` in that top bar)

2. Copy everything inside the `mods/` folder in your dj.zip 
   into the `mods/` folder in your version directory.

3. Copy everything inside the `config/` folder in your dj.zip 
   into the `config/` folder in your version directory.

3. Run Minecraft and try to start another new world to make sure things are still working.
